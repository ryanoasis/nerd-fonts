### Hasklig – _Ligatures for code_

Programming languages are limited to relatively few characters. As a result, combined character operators surfaced quite early, such as the widely used arrow (`->`), comprised of a hyphen and greater sign. It looks like an arrow if you know the analogy and squint a bit.

Composite glyphs are problematic in languages such as Haskell which utilize these complicated operators (`=>` `-<` `>>=` etc.) extensively. The readability of such complex code improves with pretty printing. Academic articles featuring Haskell code often use [lhs2tex](https://www.andres-loeh.de/lhs2tex/) to achieve an appealing rendering, but it is of no use when programming.

Some Haskellers have resorted to Unicode symbols (`⇒`, `←` _etc._), which are valid in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">ghc</span>. However they are one-character-wide and therefore eye-strainingly small. Furthermore, when displayed as substitutes to the underlying multi-character representation, as [vim2hs](https://github.com/dag/vim2hs) does, the characters go out of alignment.

Hasklig solves the problem the way typographers have always solved ill-fitting characters which co-occur often: [ligatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature). The underlying code stays the same — only the representation changes.

Not only can multi-character glyphs be rendered more vividly, other problematic things in monospaced fonts, such as spacing can be corrected.

  + Include latest changes from the Source Code Pro repository `master` branch ([adobe-fonts/source-code-pro@`14875b7`](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/commit/14875b70293e83159ad85c7d9d9081e76403d1e3)).\
    The Source Code Versions Hasklig v1.2 is based on are:
    - Roman 2.032
    - Italic 1.052
    - Variable _not supported_
  + Most notably, this update resolves (https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig/issues/123).
+ [v1.1](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig/releases/tag/1.1)
    + New ligatures `->>`, `:::`, `>=>`, `<=<`, `<=>`, `<->`
    + Switched to newer version of calt code by [Nikita Prokopov](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). It "doesn’t apply ligatures to long sequences of chars, e.g. !!!!, >>>>, etc"
    + Fixed `++` and `+++` line inconsistency in heavy italic weights

    + Updates to the latest version of SCP
    + Hasklig moves to a ligature substitution mechanism borrowed from the excellent [Fira Code by Nikita Prokopov](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
+ [v0.9]((https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig/releases/download/0.9/Hasklig-0.9.zip)): This is a major update so YMMV. Please report any issues.
	+ Converted to UFO format and updated base fonts to benefit from work done on [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/):

### Building the fonts from source

#### Requirements

To build the binary font files from source, you need to have installed the
[Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html) (AFDKO). The AFDKO
tools are widely used for font development today, and are part of most font
editor applications.

Some SVG glyphs are inserted into the fonts using Python [FontTools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/FontTools).

#### Building font instances from masters

This repository only includes so-called *master* weights of the fonts (effectively extralight and black).
The shapes of the weights in between these extremities are calculated by `makeInstancesUFO` supplied with `.designspace` files.
For convenience, the shell script **buildInstances** is provided, which  executes `makeInstancesUFO`, calculating all the italic and regular font weight shapes.

```sh
$ ./buildInstances.sh
```

#### Building one font

The key to building OTF or TTF fonts is `makeotf`, which is part of the AFDKO toolset.
Information and usage instructions can be found by executing `makeotf -h`.

In this repository, all necessary files are in place for building the OTF and TTF fonts.
For example, build a binary OTF font for the Regular style like this:

```sh
$ cd Roman/Regular/
$ makeotf -r
```

#### Building all fonts

For convenience, a shell script named **build** is provided in the root directory.
It builds all OTFs and TTFs, and can be executed by typing:

```sh
$ ./build.sh
```

or this on Windows:

```sh
> build.cmd
```


### Credits
Original idea, design and implementation of code ligatures by Ian Tuomi 2014-2015.
This typeface extends [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) with ligatures.

## Why `Hasklug` and not `Hasklig`?

What's in a name? The reason for the name change is to comply with the SIL Open Font License (OFL), in particular the [Reserved Font Name mechanism][SIL-RFN]

Some fonts have parts of their name "reserved" per the [Reserved Font Name mechanism][SIL-RFN]:
> No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
> Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
> Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
> presented to the users.

- The main goals seem to be to: `Avoid collisions`, `Protect authors`, `Minimize support`, and `Encourage derivatives`

See the [Reserved Font Name section][SIL-RFN] for additional information

## Which font?

### TL;DR

* Pick your font family and then select from the `'complete'` directory.
  * If you are on Windows pick a font with the `'Windows Compatible'` suffix.
    * This includes specific tweaks to ensure the font works on Windows, in particular monospace identification and font name length limitations
  * If you are limited to monospaced fonts (because of your terminal, etc) then pick a font with the `'Mono'` suffix.
    * This denotes that the Nerd Font glyphs will be monospaced not necessarily that the entire font will be monospaced

### Ligatures

By the *Nerd Font* policy, the variant with the `'Mono'` suffix is not supposed to have any ligatures.
Use the non-*Mono* variants to have ligatures.

### Explanation

Once you narrow down your font choice of family (`Droid Sans`, `Inconsolata`, etc) and style (`bold`, `italic`, etc) you have 2 main choices:

#### `Option 1: Download already patched font`

 * download an already patched font from the `complete` folder
   * This is most likely the one you want. It includes **all** of the glyphs from all of the glyph sets. Only caution here is that some fonts have glyphs in the _same_ code point so to include everything some had to be moved to alternate code points.

#### `Option 2: Patch your own font`

 * patch your own variations with the various options provided by the font patcher (see each font's readme for full list of combinations available)
   * This is the option you want if the font you use is _not_ already included or you want maximum control of what's included
   * This contains a list of _all permutations_ of the various glyphs. E.g. You want the font with only [Octicons][octicons] or you want the font with just [Font Awesome][font-awesome] and [Devicons][vorillaz-devicons]. The goal is to provide every combination possible in this folder.

## Variations (Combinations)

> The combinations and total number of combinations are provided here for reference if you want to create your own variation of a patched Nerd Font.

### Why aren't all variations included ?

Combinations are no longer included by default because of the large inflation in size it caused the Repository _and_ the amount of time it takes to rebuild all of the combinations. This issue would exponentially get worse as the numbers of Fonts and Glyph Sets provided increase.
