The Vic Fieger fonts are freeware, to be downloaded and used by anyone who wants them for free. I didn't put them here so people couldn't use them! You don't have to ask for my permission, though it's always good to receive an e-mail from somebody to show me what they are using them for.
If you wish to write to let me know how a certain font will be used, and for what purpose, send your e-mail to: vic@vicfieger.com
