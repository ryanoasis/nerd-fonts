# Comic Shanns Mono

A legible monospace font... the very typeface you’ve been trained to recognize since childhood.
The Comic Sans inspired monospaced font that's coming to a terminal or editor near you!

For more information have a look at the upstream website: https://github.com/jesusmgg/comic-shanns-mono

* Nerd Fonts corrects some issues of the font
* The font is based on _Comic Shanns v1_ by Shannon Miwa (https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns)
* The **Bold** weight has been manually added by Nerd Fonts, inspired by Thai Pangsakulyanont's _Comic Mono_ (https://github.com/dtinth/comic-mono-font)

Version: 1.3

## Which font?

### TL;DR

* Pick your font family:
  * If you are limited to monospaced fonts (because of your terminal, etc) then pick a font with `Nerd Font Mono` (or `NFM`).
  * If you want to have bigger icons (usually around 1.5 normal letters wide) pick a font without `Mono` i.e. `Nerd Font` (or `NF`). Most terminals support this, but ymmv.
  * If you work in a proportional context (GUI elements or edit a presentation etc) pick a font with `Nerd Font Propo` (or `NFP`).

### Ligatures

Ligatures are generally preserved in the patched fonts.
Nerd Fonts `v2.0.0` had no ligatures in the `Nerd Font Mono` fonts, this has been dropped with `v2.1.0`.
If you have a ligature-aware terminal and don't want ligatures you can (usually) disable them in the terminal settings.

### Explanation

Once you narrow down your font choice of family (`Droid Sans`, `Inconsolata`, etc) and style (`bold`, `italic`, etc) you have 2 main choices:

#### `Option 1: Download already patched font`

 * For a stable version download a font package from the [release page](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases)
 * Or download the development version from the folders here

#### `Option 2: Patch your own font`

 * Patch your own variations with the various options provided by the font patcher (i.e. not include all symbols for smaller font size)
