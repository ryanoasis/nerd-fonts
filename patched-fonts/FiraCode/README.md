Fira Code is a Fira Mono font extended with a set of ligatures for
common programming multi-character combinations. This is just a font
rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps
to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like ..
or // ligatures allow us to correct spacing.

## Which font?

### TL;DR

0. Pick your font family and then select from the `'complete'` directory.
  * Are you on Windows? Pick a font with the suffix `'Windows Compatible'`
  * Are you limited to mono fonts (because of your terminal, etc)? Pick a font with the suffix `'Mono'`

### Explanation

Once you narrow done your font choice of family (Droid Sans, Inconsolata, etc) and style (bold, italic, etc) you are provided with 3 main folders choices:
 * complete
  * This is most likely the one you want. It includes **all** of the glyphs from all of the glyph sets. Only caution here is that some fonts have glyphs in the _same_ code point so to include everything some had to be moved to alternate code points.
 * alternative
  * This attempts to contain _all permutations_ of the various glyphs. E.g. You want the font with only [Octicons][octicons] or you want the font with just [Font Awesome][font-awesome] and [Devicons][vorillaz-devicons]. The goal is to provide every combination possible in this folder.
 * minimal
  * This contains just the glyphs needed to use [vim-devicons][vim-devicons]. This is mostly provided for historical purposes. This might end up being removed at some point if it ends up causing too much confusion and/or providing little purpose in the grand scheme of things.
