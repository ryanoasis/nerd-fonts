The monofur typeface by tobias b koehler (unci@tigerden.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a monospaced geometric rounded sans serif font based on the
eurofurence typeface family.

The character set includes Roman, Greek and Cyrillic characters as well
as box drawing characters. File format is TrueType for PC (under 
Windows, Linux etc).

These fonts are freeware and can be distributed as long as they are
together with this text file. I would appreciate it though if you could
contact me at unci@tigerden.com if you put them on a server. Free
samples from commercial users are always very welcome. :)
