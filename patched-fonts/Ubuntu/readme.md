  Ubuntu Font Family
 ======================

The Ubuntu Font Family are a set of matching new libre/open fonts in
development during 2010--2011.  And with further expansion work and
bug fixing during 2015.  The development is being funded by
Canonical Ltd on behalf the wider Free Software community and the
Ubuntu project.  The technical font design work and implementation is
being undertaken by Dalton Maag.

Both the final font Truetype/OpenType files and the design files used
to produce the font family are distributed under an open licence and
you are expressly encouraged to experiment, modify, share and improve.

## Which font?

### TL;DR

* Pick your font family and then select from the `'complete'` directory.
  * If you are on Windows pick a font with the `'Windows Compatible'` suffix.
    * This includes specific tweaks to ensure the font works on Windows, in particular monospace identification and font name length limitations
  * If you are limited to monospaced fonts (because of your terminal, etc) then pick a font with the `'Mono'` suffix.
  * If you want to have bigger icons (usually around 1.5 normal letters wide) pick a font without `'Mono'` suffix. Most terminals support this, but ymmv.

### Ligatures

Ligatures are generally preserved in the patched fonts.
Nerd Fonts `v2.0.0` had no ligatures in the `Nerd Font Mono` fonts, this has been dropped with `v2.1.0`.
If you have a ligature-aware terminal and don't want ligatures you can (usually) disable them in the terminal settings.

### Explanation

Once you narrow down your font choice of family (`Droid Sans`, `Inconsolata`, etc) and style (`bold`, `italic`, etc) you have 2 main choices:

#### `Option 1: Download already patched font`

 * For a stable version download a font package from the [release page](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases)
 * Or download the development version from the `complete` folder here

#### `Option 2: Patch your own font`

 * patch your own variations with the various options provided by the font patcher (see each font's readme for full list of combinations available)
   * This is the option you want if the font you use is _not_ already included or you want maximum control of what's included
   * This contains a list of _all permutations_ of the various glyphs. E.g. You want the font with only [Octicons][octicons] or you want the font with just [Font Awesome][font-awesome] and [Devicons][vorillaz-devicons].
