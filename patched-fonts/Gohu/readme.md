<b>THANKS AND AKNOWLEDGMENTS</b>
The Unicode versions of the 11px font are based extensively on the fixed 6x10 font by Markus Kuhn (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs-fonts.html).
I used the Terminus font in 14 px with great satisfaction for a long time before I decided to make gohufont 14 px, so it surely inspired me and they may share some similarities in appearance. It is not a derivative work though. Thanks to Dimitar Zhekov for his great font.

## Which font?

### TL;DR

* Pick your font family and then select from the `'complete'` directory.
  * If you are on Windows pick a font with the `'Windows Compatible'` suffix.
    * This includes specific tweaks to ensure the font works on Windows, in particular monospace identification and font name length limitations
  * If you are limited to monospaced fonts (because of your terminal, etc) then pick a font with the `'Mono'` suffix.
    * This denotes that the Nerd Font glyphs will be monospaced not necessarily that the entire font will be monospaced

### Ligatures

By the *Nerd Font* policy, the variant with the `'Mono'` suffix is not supposed to have any ligatures.
Use the non-*Mono* variants to have ligatures.

### Explanation

Once you narrow down your font choice of family (`Droid Sans`, `Inconsolata`, etc) and style (`bold`, `italic`, etc) you have 2 main choices:

#### `Option 1: Download already patched font`

 * download an already patched font from the `complete` folder
   * This is most likely the one you want. It includes **all** of the glyphs from all of the glyph sets. Only caution here is that some fonts have glyphs in the _same_ code point so to include everything some had to be moved to alternate code points.

#### `Option 2: Patch your own font`

 * patch your own variations with the various options provided by the font patcher (see each font's readme for full list of combinations available)
   * This is the option you want if the font you use is _not_ already included or you want maximum control of what's included
   * This contains a list of _all permutations_ of the various glyphs. E.g. You want the font with only [Octicons][octicons] or you want the font with just [Font Awesome][font-awesome] and [Devicons][vorillaz-devicons]. The goal is to provide every combination possible in this folder.

## Variations (Combinations)

> The combinations and total number of combinations are provided here for reference if you want to create your own variation of a patched Nerd Font.

### Why aren't all variations included ?

Combinations are no longer included by default because of the large inflation in size it caused the Repository _and_ the amount of time it takes to rebuild all of the combinations. This issue would exponentially get worse as the numbers of Fonts and Glyph Sets provided increase.
