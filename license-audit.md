# License audit

## Licenses found and basic summary of each

* MIT - all good do what you want basically
* CC 4 - share, adapt and change in any format is okay
* SIL OFL 1.1 - free to use, copy, merge, modify, redistribute with conditions: no selling, must contain this original license, must comply to the RFN (Reserved Font Names)
* Apache 2.0 - Basically permissive like MIT but a few things to note. Must include original copyright, note any significant changes to original code, copy of NOTICE file. Modified code does not need to remain under Apache 2.0.
* Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0) - free to share and change. Must give proper attribution. Must distribute under same license. The font itself once patched indeed is.
* Bitstream Vera License v1.00 - do what want, no selling, must rename font.
* Do What The Fuck You Want To - the name summarizes the rules.
* Go License - Redistribution and everything is allowed. Only limitation is use of Google Inc. to endorse/promote.
* Vic Fieger License - free to do whatever you want
* Monofur Free License - free do what you want just require license file
* Bitstream License - do what you want, attribution required
* Ubuntu Font License 1.0 - do what you want, attribution and license must be included. There may be some ambiguity on the naming, but I believe we comply with it:
  * > (c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be
renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add
additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the
Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of
the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of
the new work, appended to that name.
