# Inconsolata LGC

Inconsolata is one of the most suitable font for programmers created by Raph
Levien. Since the original Inconsolata does not contain Cyrillic alphabet,
it was slightly inconvenient for not a few programmers from Russia.

Inconsolata LGC is a modified version of Inconsolata with added the Cyrillic
alphabet which directly descends from Inconsolata Hellenic supporting modern
Greek.
