Martian Mono is a monospaced version of the Martian Grotesk font for code style design. It inherits Grotesk’s brutal and eye-catching aesthetics as well as all of its benefits—metrics equilibrium, readability and intelligibility, and convenience for web developers and designers who believe in a systematic approach to design.

The typeface features a tall x-height, and it has vertical metrics which guarantee equal space is present above the cap height and under the baseline. The latter makes this typeface an on-screen workhorse: it is evenly placed on buttons, inputs, lists, and forms. When coupled together, all the above features make Martian Mono a reasonable choice for any user interface design.

When choosing a font format, prefer `ttf` for variable and `otf` for static on macOS, and `ttf` for Windows.

## Font size and legibility

Originally designed for the screen, the glyph heights stick to the pixel grid on commonly used font sizes. In addition, it comes equipped with OpenType and TrueType hinting, and Martian Mono appears legible on most platforms, even when being rendered in small sizes.

For the best results use the following pairs of size / line height:

* 7.5 / 10 (or 14, 18, etc.) px
* 10 / 12 (or 16, 20, etc.) px
* 12.5 / 14 (or 18, 22, etc.) px
* 15 / 20 (or 24, 28, etc.) px

## Roadmap

* Coding ligatures (blocked by [Glyphs app bug](https://forum.glyphsapp.com/t/glyphs-crashes-because-of-pos-rule/22838/17))
* Powerline symbols
* Cyrillic script for Bulgarian, Serbian, and Macedonian
* Italics
