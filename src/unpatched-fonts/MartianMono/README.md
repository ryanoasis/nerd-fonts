# Martian Mono

**Martian Mono** is a monospaced version of the Martian Grotesk font for
code style design. It inherits Groteskâ€™s brutal and eye-catching aesthetics.

For more information have a look at the upstream website: https://github.com/evilmartians/mono

The available widths at Nerd Fonts are:
* `Cn` stands for _Consensed_
* `Std` stands for _Standard_

The font filenames are changed to be a bit more expressive.

Version: 1.0.0
