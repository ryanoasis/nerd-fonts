# JetBrains Mono: a typeface made for developers
![Alt text](images/main-img@2x.png)

JetBrains Mono is available as a standalone download, and is also bundled in all JetBrains IDEs. Discover more font features & design on its [web page](https://jetbrains.com/mono/). 

Default version of JetBrains Mono comes with OpenType features and ligatures (which can always be toggled on & off in the settings). If your IDE doesn‚Äôt support OpenType, use a special version of the font ‚Äî [JetBrains Mono NL](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/tree/master/fonts/ttf), which doesn‚Äôt include any ligatures.

# **Installation**

### **JetBrains IDEs**

The most recent version of JetBrains Mono ships with your JetBrains IDE starting with v2019.3.

Select JetBrains Mono in the IDE settings: go to `Preferences/Settings` ‚Üí `Editor` ‚Üí `Font`, and then select JetBrains Mono from the **Font** dropdown.

### Brew (macOS only)

1. Tap the font cask to make the Jetbrains Mono font available :

    ```console

   - _Windows_. Select all font files in the folder, right-click any of them, then pick **Install** from the menu.

üìù Note: If you have previously installed JetBrains Mono, please uninstall all previous versions to exclude conflicts and errors in rendering.

## Font Features

### Increased x-height
While characters remain standard in width, the height of the lowercase is maximized. This approach keeps code lines to the length that developers expect, and it helps improve rendering in small size, since each symbol occupies more pixels.

### Distinctiveness of symbols

## Ligatures for Code
A ligature is a character consisting of two or more joined symbols. Traditionally, it was introduced as a space-saving technique in printed texts. In code, this technique is adopted to show operators and is used mainly for two purposes:
1. To **reduce noise** by merging symbols and removing details so the eyes are processing less:

2. To balance whitespace more efficiently by shifting the glyphs in certain cases:

üìù Note: if your IDE doesn‚Äôt support OpenType features and ligatures, use [JetBrains Mono NL](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/tree/master/fonts/ttf) instead.
