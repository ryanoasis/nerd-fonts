# Comic Shanns Mono

A legible monospace font... the very typeface youâ€™ve been trained to recognize since childhood.
The Comic Sans inspired monospaced font that's coming to a terminal or editor near you!

* Nerd Fonts corrects some issues of the font
* The font is based on _Comic Shanns v2_ by Shannon Miwa (https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns)
* The excellent fork with references by Rodrigo Batista de Moraes is used instead (https://github.com/jesusmgg/comic-shanns-mono/pull/7, https://github.com/Rodrigodd/comic-shanns-mono)
* The caron is corrected (vertically mirrored) by Nerd Fonts
* dcaron and tcaron are corrected with apothrophe by Nerd Fonts
* The **Bold** weight has been manually added by Nerd Fonts, inspired by Thai Pangsakulyanont's _Comic Mono_ (https://github.com/dtinth/comic-mono-font)
