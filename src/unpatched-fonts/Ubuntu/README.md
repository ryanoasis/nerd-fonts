# Ubuntu

The Ubuntu Font Family are a set of matching new libre/open fonts in
development during 2010--2011.  And with further expansion work and
bug fixing during 2015.  The development is being funded by
Canonical Ltd on behalf the wider Free Software community and the
Ubuntu project.  The technical font design work and implementation is
being undertaken by Dalton Maag.

Both the final font Truetype/OpenType files and the design files used
to produce the font family are distributed under an open licence and
you are expressly encouraged to experiment, modify, share and improve.

The `fi`, `fl`, and similar ligatures are removed because they would block some Font Awesome glyphs.

Version: 0.83

## Preprocessed Source Font

For the _Ubuntu Condensed_ font Nerd Fonts corrected the `OS/2` `usWidthClass` to
Condensed (3) by direct patching.

The script used is in the `Condensed/` directory.
