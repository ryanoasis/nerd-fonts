# Rec Mono for Code

**Recursive Mono** or **Rec Mono** is a variable type family built
for better code and UI. It is inspired by casual script signpainting,
but designed primarily to meet the needs of programming environments
and application interfaces.

### Rec Mono Duotone
A personal favorite â€“ this use the Linear style for Regular text and
Casual styles for Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic text. In many themes
that use italic styles, this will give most code a utilitarian look,
but set comments, some keywords, and certain headlines in the
more-handwritten Casual style.

### Rec Mono Linear
An everyday workhorse for code. Slightly-boxy shapes maximize legibility
while maintaining a standard monospace width, while a few quirks add a
little bit of extra personality and differentiation between
similarly-shaped characters.

### Rec Mono Casual
A party in a font. Fun and wacky shapes, simplified enough for small sizes
but curvy enough to have plenty of character. Best in casual coding and
non-primary terminals.

### Rec Mono SemiCasual
Sets the CASL axis at `0.5` for font that is serious but softened a
little bit. This isn't the best choice for text at large sizes (like
headlines on a website), but can be a really nice balance in code.
