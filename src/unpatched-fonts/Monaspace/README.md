# Github Monaspace

The Monaspace type system: a monospaced type superfamily with some modern tricks
up its sleeves. It is comprised of five variable axis typefaces. Each one has a
distinct voice, but they are all metrics-compatible with one another, allowing
you to mix and match them for a more expressive typographical palette.

Light weight added only after Nerd Font v3.1.0 release, see Issue 1433.
