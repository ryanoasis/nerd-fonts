 - `test-fonts.sh`: allow wrapping at any number by @hasecilu #1270

## v3.0.1

This bugfix release handles the following issues.

### Fixes
 - Revive some ligature removal (only of problematic ligs)
 - Correct Octicons scale (of very few icons)
 - Fix logging with AppImage `fontforge`
 - Drop box-drawing glyphs from Symbols Only fonts
 - Reintroduce upstream-dropped `oct-file-symlink-directory`

## v3.0.0

This major release introduces some breaking changes:

### Breaking 1: Naming

This release fixes some long standing issues that are due to the naming of the fonts: There is a completely new naming scheme. This might be inconvientient for existing setups, sorry.
 - Some fonts will have `Nerd Font` in the name while other have it abbreviated as `NF`. This is needed because some names just were too long. (Same for `Nerd Font Mono` and `NFM`.)
 - There are no `Windows Compatible` fonts anymore. All fonts work on all platforms.
 - The `Complete` from the font names (and the repo directories) has been dropped (Complete is the new normal).
 - The name parts will be ordered as expected with style and weight last (`Somefont Bold Nerd Font` -> `Somefont Nerd Font Bold`).
 - The filename will have no blanks anymore.

### Breaking 2: Material Design Icons Codepoints

The old Material Design Icon codepoints are finally dropped. Due to an historic mistake we placed them in between some asiatic glyphs, breaking that script.
Since v2.3.0 the (updated and expanded) Material Design Icons have new codepoints in the 5 digit region.
 - Dropped codepoints `F500`... and class names `nf-mdi-*`
 - New codepoints `F0001`... and class names `nf-md-*`
 - The whole discussions are here: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/365
 - A translation table is available here: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/1059#issuecomment-1404891287
 - There are tools out there that probably can update your configuration.

Otherwise this is a 'Update release', so now the good stuff:

### Next Release Outlook

The `v3.0.0` release will bring two bigger changes:

#### Material Design Icons
The Material Design Icons have to move codepoints. Historically we patch them in between `F500` - `FD46`; but part of that range is needed for Chinese and other glyphs. With #773 and _Plan 5+_ of #365 their new home will be after `F0001`. And they grow considerably.

The `v2.3.x` release has both, the 'old' and the 'new' codepoints to enable you an easier transision. **Please change** already **now** your prompts and other uses to the new codepoints. Release `v3.0.0` will finally drop the old codepoints (`F500` - `FD46`).

#### Naming
Naming will also change. The name parts will move to places where they are customarily expected (e.g. weight and style comes last). This will fix some more problems. Probably we will drop the `Complete` monicker, as ... everyone uses the complete versions, it just takes precious space in the names.
The details are not fixed yet, follow [#1074](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/discussions/1074) to keep up to date.
