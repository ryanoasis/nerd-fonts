<h2>v3.0.0 Release (2023.04.30)</h2>
<details>
  <summary>v3.0.0 Details</summary>
  <div markdown="1">
This major release introduces some breaking changes:

### Breaking 1: Naming

This release fixes some long standing issues that are due to the naming of the fonts: There is a completely new naming scheme. This might be inconvientient for existing setups, sorry.
* Some fonts will have `Nerd Font` in the name while other have it abbreviated as `NF`. This is needed because some names just were too long. (Same for `Nerd Font Mono` and `NFM`.)
* There are no `Windows Compatible` fonts anymore. All fonts work on all platforms.
* The `Complete` from the font names (and the repo directories) has been dropped (Complete is the new normal).
* The name parts will be ordered as expected with style and weight last (`Somefont Bold Nerd Font` -> `Somefont Nerd Font Bold`).
* The filename will have no blanks anymore.

### Breaking 2: Material Design Icons Codepoints

The old Material Design Icon codepoints are finally dropped. Due to an historic mistake we placed them in between some asiatic glyphs, breaking that script.
Since v2.3.0 the (updated and expanded) Material Design Icons have new codepoints in the 5 digit region.
* Dropped codepoints `F500`... and class names `nf-mdi-*`
* New codepoints `F0001`... and class names `nf-md-*`
* The whole discussions are here: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/365
* A translation table is available here: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/1059#issuecomment-1404891287
* There are tools out there that probably can update your configuration.

Otherwise this is a 'Update release', so now the good stuff:

### Updates
* Update `Agave` to v37
* Update `Arimo` to 1.33
* Update `DaddyTimeMono` to 1.2.3
* Update `Fira Mono` to 3.206
* Update `Go Mono` to 2.010
* Update `Hermit` to 2.0
* Update `IBM Plex` to 2.3
* Update `Iosevka` to 22.1.0
* Update `Literation` to 2.1.5
* Update `Lilex` to 2.000
* Update `mononoki` to 1.6
* Update `MPlus` to ... current
* Update `Overpass` to 3.0.5
* Update `Roboto Mono` to 3.0
* Update `Source Code Pro` to 2.038
* Update `Terminus` to 4.49.2
* Update `Victor Mono` to 1.5.4
* Update the Octicons set to 18.3.0

### Features
* New font `ComicShannsMono`
* New variant in release `Nerd Font Propo` for GUI usecases
* Patch in heavy angle brackets
* Patch in boxdrawing glyphs (if the font has no complete set)
* Repair Panose info if source font has broken data
* Reform PowerlineExtra sizing
* Autocreate a `FontPatcher.zip` from `HEAD`
* Create a json database with css names
* Disentangle `Iosevka` into two packets (one for `Iosevka Term`)
* Add option to manipulate `xAvgCharWidth` (needed rarely by self-patchers)
* Add option to allow italic-less fonts with oblique
* Add `--debug` and `--dry` to `font-patcher`
* Add logging into file to `font-patcher`
* Add `NERDFONTS` environment variable to transport options through `gotta-patch-em`

### Improvements
* Fix `Caskaydia Code` height different to `Cascadia Code` (hinting problem) (font is now `ttf` instead of `otf`!)

### Fixes
* Fix baseline to basline distance (line gap) for some fonts
* Fix weather icons cloud scaling
* Fix UniqueID of the fonts
* Fix `Bitstream Vera` name: Is now `Bitstrom Wera` due to licensing issue
* No fix, but: Drop support for Python 2

### Remark
I can feel the hurt of the breaking changes, but some old decisions just proved to be wrong.
Many thanks to all the Issue reporters and pull requesters that help keep this project going!

<h2>v2.3.3 Release (2023.01.24)</h2>
<details>
  <summary>v2.3.3 Details</summary>
  <div markdown="1">
The `v2.3.x` release is an interim release that tackles a lot technical issues and some updates. It is the preparatory step for `v3.0.0` that will update 'everything' and introduce new concepts. See [#1074](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/discussions/1074).

## Next Release Outlook

The `v3.0.0` release will bring two bigger changes:

### Material Design Icons
The Material Design Icons have to move codepoints. Historically we patch them in between `F500` - `FD46`; but part of that range is needed for Chinese and other glyphs. With #773 and _Plan 5+_ of #365 their new home will be after `F0001`. And they grow considerably.

The `v2.3.x` release has both, the 'old' and the 'new' codepoints to enable you an easier transision. **Please change** already **now** your prompts and other uses to the new codepoints. Release `v3.0.0` will finally drop the old codepoints (`F500` - `FD46`).

### Naming
Naming will also change. The name parts will move to places where they are customarily expected (e.g. weight and style comes last). This will fix some more problems. Probably we will drop the `Complete` monicker, as ... everyone uses the complete versions, it just takes precious space in the names.
The details are not fixed yet, follow [#1074](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/discussions/1074) to keep up to date.

### Details
  - [Release 2.3.0](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/tag/v2.3.0)
  - [Release 2.3.1](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/tag/v2.3.0)
  - [Release 2.3.2](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/tag/v2.3.0)

## Remark
This release was even more bumpy then the previous one. Please accept my apologies.
Many thanks to all the Issue reporters and pull requesters that help keep this project going!
